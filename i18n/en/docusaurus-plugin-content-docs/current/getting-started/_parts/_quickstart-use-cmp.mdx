Cloudpods can unify and manage resources from other cloud platforms.

In the `Multi-Cloud Management` menu, select `Cloud Accounts` and create a new one. Fill in the authentication information for the corresponding cloud platform according to your needs. After configuring the cloud account, the Cloudpods service will synchronize the corresponding cloud platform resources. Once the synchronization is complete, you can view them in the front-end.
