To create the first virtual machine, follow these three steps:

#### 1. Import image

Go to [CentOS 7 cloud host image](https://cloud.centos.org/centos/7/images/) and choose a GenericCloud image. Copy the image URL.

In the `Host` menu, select `System image`, and then select `Upload`. Enter the image name, select `Input image URL`, paste the CentOS 7 image URL, and click `OK`.

Visit https://docs.openstack.org/image-guide/obtain-images.html for more virtual machine images.

#### 2. Create network (VPC and IP subnet)

[Create VPC] In the `Network` menu, select `VPC` submenu, and then select `Create`. Enter the name, such as `vpc0`, and select the target network segment, such as `192.168.0.0/16`. Click `Create`.

[Create IP subnet] After VPC creation, select the `IP subnet` submenu, and then select `Create`. Enter the name, such as `vnet0`, select the VPC as the created VPC `vpc0`, select the availability zone, enter the `subnet network segment`, such as `192.168.100.0/24`. Click `Create`.

[Typical network configuration](../../guides/virt/network/examples) provides several common host network configurations for reference.

#### 3. Create virtual machine

In the `Host` menu, select `Virtual Machine`, and then select `Create`. Enter the hostname, select the image and IP subnet, and create the virtual machine.
